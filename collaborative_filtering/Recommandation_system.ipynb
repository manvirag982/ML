    "The matrix `Y` (a `num_movies` $\\times$ `num_users` matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$ (from 1 to 5). The matrix `R` is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i, j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i, j) = 0$ otherwise. The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated, that is, the entries with $R(i, j) = 0$. This will allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand the matrix `Y`, the following cell will compute the average movie rating for the first movie (Toy Story) and print its average rating.\n",

    "Now, you will start implementing the collaborative filtering learning algorithm. You will start by implementing the cost function (without regularization).\n",

    "The collaborative filtering algorithm in the setting of movie recommendations considers a set of n-dimensional parameter vectors $x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n_m)}$ and $\\theta^{(1)} , \\dots, \\theta^{(n_u)}$, where the model predicts the rating for movie $i$ by user $j$ as $y^{(i,j)} = \\left( \\theta^{(j)} \\right)^T x^{(i)}$. Given a dataset that consists of a set of ratings produced by some users on some movies, you wish to learn the parameter vectors $x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(n_m)}, \\theta^{(1)}, \\dots, \\theta^{(n_u)}$ that produce the best fit (minimizes the squared error).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete the code in `cofiCostFunc` to compute the cost function and gradient for collaborative filtering. Note that the parameters to the function (i.e., the values that you are trying to learn) are `X` and `Theta`. In order to use an off-the-shelf minimizer such as `scipy`'s `minimize` function, the cost function has been set up to unroll the parameters into a single vector called `params`. You had previously used the same vector unrolling method in the neural networks programming exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Collaborative filtering cost function\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "**Implementation Note**: We strongly encourage you to use a vectorized implementation to compute $J$, since it will later by called many times by `scipy`'s optimization package. As usual, it might be easiest to first write a non-vectorized implementation (to make sure you have the right answer), and the modify it to become a vectorized implementation (checking that the vectorization steps do not change your algorithm’s output). To come up with a vectorized implementation, the following tip might be helpful: You can use the $R$ matrix to set selected entries to 0. For example, `R * M` will do an element-wise multiplication between `M`\n",
    "and `R`; since `R` only has elements with values either 0 or 1, this has the effect of setting the elements of M to 0 only when the corresponding value in R is 0. Hence, `np.sum( R * M)` is the sum of all the elements of `M` for which the corresponding element in `R` equals 1.\n",
